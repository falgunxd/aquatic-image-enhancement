# Aquatic image enhancement
## Abstract
Aquatic images find application in various domains, such as marine research, aquatic habitat inspection, underwater surveillance, mineral identification, and more. However, aquatic shots are significantly impacted during the capture process due to light absorption and scattering. As depth increases, longer wavelengths are absorbed by water, causing the images to appear predominantly bluish-green, with red wavelengths being absorbed due to their higher wavelength. These phenomena lead to substantial image degradation, resulting in low contrast, color distortion, and reduced visibility. Therefore, aquatic images require enhancement to improve their quality for various applications while preserving the valuable information they contain.
